# mule (the mediocre unreal level editor)
mule is a work-in-progress level editor for cooked unreal engine 4 map files

it was named as such because I like acronyms and I intend for the tool to be reliable and capable of doing some of the hard work for you

### Thanks
- Thank you to [localcc](https://github.com/localcc)'s [rust rewrite](https://github.com/AstroTechies/unrealmodding/tree/main/unreal_asset) of [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr)'s [UAssetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) which I used for asset editing - without either this project would not have been possible
- Thank you to [fedor](https://github.com/not-fl3) and [emilk](https://github.com/emilk) for the wonderful [miniquad](https://crates.io/crates/miniquad) and [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) crates which allowed me to build the tool how I wanted
- Thank you to [LongerWarrior](https://github.com/LongerWarrior) for pointing out everything I was missing in the actor duplication code
